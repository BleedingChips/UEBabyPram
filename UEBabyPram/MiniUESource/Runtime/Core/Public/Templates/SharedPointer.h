/**
 *	SharedPointer - Unreal smart pointer library
 *
 *	This is a smart pointer library consisting of shared references (TSharedRef), shared pointers (TSharedPtr),
 *	weak pointers (TWeakPtr) as well as related helper functions and classes.  This implementation is modeled
 *	after the C++0x standard library's shared_ptr as well as Boost smart pointers.
 *
 *	Benefits of using shared references and pointers:
 *
 *		Clean syntax.  You can copy, dereference and compare shared pointers just like regular C++ pointers.
 *		Prevents memory leaks.  Resources are destroyed automatically when there are no more shared references.
 *		Weak referencing.  Weak pointers allow you to safely check when an object has been destroyed.
 *		Thread safety.  Includes "thread safe" version that can be safely accessed from multiple threads.
 *		Ubiquitous.  You can create shared pointers to virtually *any* type of object.
 *		Runtime safety.  Shared references are never null and can always be dereferenced.
 *		No reference cycles.  Use weak pointers to break reference cycles.
 *		Confers intent.  You can easily tell an object *owner* from an *observer*.
 *		Performance.  Shared pointers have minimal overhead.  All operations are constant-time.
 *		Robust features.  Supports 'const', forward declarations to incomplete types, type-casting, etc.
 *		Memory.  Only twice the size of a C++ pointer in 64-bit (plus a shared 16-byte reference controller.)
 *
 *
 *	This library contains the following smart pointers:
 *
 *		TSharedRef - Non-nullable, reference counted non-intrusive authoritative smart pointer
 *		TSharedPtr - Reference counted non-intrusive authoritative smart pointer
 *		TWeakPtr - Reference counted non-intrusive weak pointer reference
 *
 *
 *	Additionally, the following helper classes and functions are defined:
 *
 *		MakeShareable() - Used to initialize shared pointers from C++ pointers (enables implicit conversion)
 *		MakeShared<T>(...) - Used to construct a T alongside its controller, saving an allocation.
 *		TSharedFromThis - You can derive your own class from this to acquire a TSharedRef from "this"
 *		StaticCastSharedRef() - Static cast utility function, typically used to downcast to a derived type. 
 *		ConstCastSharedRef() - Converts a 'const' reference to 'mutable' smart reference
 *		StaticCastSharedPtr() - Dynamic cast utility function, typically used to downcast to a derived type. 
 *		ConstCastSharedPtr() - Converts a 'const' smart pointer to 'mutable' smart pointer
 *		StaticCastWeakPtr() - Dynamic cast utility function, typically used to downcast to a derived type.
 *		ConstCastWeakPtr() - Converts a 'const' smart pointer to 'mutable' smart pointer
 *
 *
 *	Examples:
 *		- Please see 'SharedPointerTesting.inl' for various examples of shared pointers and references!
 *
 *
 *	Tips:
 *		- Use TSharedRef instead of TSharedPtr whenever possible -- it can never be nullptr!
 *		- You can call TSharedPtr::Reset() to release a reference to your object (and potentially deallocate) 
 *		- Use the MakeShareable() helper function to implicitly convert to TSharedRefs or TSharedPtrs
 *		- Prefer MakeShared<T>(...) to MakeShareable(new T(...))
 *		- You can never reset a TSharedRef or assign it to nullptr, but you can assign it a new object
 *		- Shared pointers assume ownership of objects -- no need to call delete yourself!
 *		- Usually you should "operator new" when passing a C++ pointer to a new shared pointer
 *		- Use TSharedRef or TSharedPtr when passing smart pointers as function parameters, not TWeakPtr
 *		- The "thread-safe" versions of smart pointers are a bit slower -- only use them when needed
 *		- You can forward declare shared pointers to incomplete types, just how you'd expect to!
 *		- Shared pointers of compatible types will be converted implicitly (e.g. upcasting)
 *		- You can create a typedef to TSharedRef< MyClass > to make it easier to type
 *		- For best performance, minimize calls to TWeakPtr::Pin (or conversions to TSharedRef/TSharedPtr)
 *		- Your class can return itself as a shared reference if you derive from TSharedFromThis
 *		- To downcast a pointer to a derived object class, use the StaticCastSharedRef, StaticCastSharedRef or StaticCastWeakPtr functions
 *		- 'const' objects are fully supported with shared pointers!
 *		- You can make a 'const' pointer mutable using the ConstCastSharedRef, ConstCastSharedPtr or ConstCastWeakPtr functions
 *		
 *
 *	Limitations:
 *
 *		- Shared pointers are not compatible with Unreal objects (UObject classes)!
 *		- Currently only types with that have regular destructors (no custom deleters)
 *		- Dynamically-allocated arrays are not supported yet (e.g. MakeShareable( new int32[20] ))
 *
 *
 *	Differences from other implementations (e.g. boost:shared_ptr, std::shared_ptr):
 *
 *		- Type names and method names are more consistent with Unreal's codebase
 *		- You must use Pin() to convert weak pointers to shared pointers (no explicit constructor)
 *		- Thread-safety features are optional instead of forced
 *		- TSharedFromThis returns a shared *reference*, not a shared *pointer*
 *		- Some features were omitted (e.g. use_count(), unique(), etc.)
 *		- No exceptions are allowed (all related features have been omitted)
 *		- Custom allocators and custom delete functions are not supported yet
 *		- Our implementation supports non-nullable smart pointers (TSharedRef)
 *		- Several other new features added, such as MakeShareable and nullptr assignment
 *
 *
 *	Why did we write our own Unreal shared pointer instead of using available alternatives?
 *
 *		- std::shared_ptr (and even tr1::shared_ptr) is not yet available on all platforms
 *		- Allows for a more consistent implementation on all compilers and platforms
 *		- Can work seamlessly with other Unreal containers and types
 *		- Better control over platform specifics, including threading and optimizations
 *		- We want thread-safety features to be optional (for performance)
 *		- We've added our own improvements (MakeShareable, assign to nullptr, etc.)
 *		- Exceptions were not needed nor desired in our implementation
 *		- We wanted more control over performance (inlining, memory, use of virtuals, etc.)
 *		- Potentially easier to debug (liberal code comments, etc.)
 *		- Prefer not to introduce new third party dependencies when not needed
